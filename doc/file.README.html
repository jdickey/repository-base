<p>This Gem supplies a class, <code>Repository::Base</code>, which can be used as a base class
for Repositories in an application that uses the
<a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/dataMapper.html">Data Mapper pattern</a>.
As described by Fowler, Data Mapper “moves data between objects and a database
while keeping them independent of each other and the mapper itself”.</p>

<p>This was originally developed within the structure of an R&amp;D test-bed application,
<a href="https://github.com/jdickey/new_poc"><code>new_poc</code></a>. That app has a fairly wide-ranging
history; after browsing its README and
<a href="https://github.com/jdickey/new_poc/commits">commit history</a>, you may find Pull
Requests <a href="https://github.com/jdickey/new_poc/pull/153">#153</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/jdickey/new_poc/pull/153">#200</a> informative as to the
historical basis of this code.</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<p>Add this line to your application’s Gemfile:</p>

<p><code>ruby
gem 'repository-base'
</code></p>

<p>And then execute:</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby">$ bundle
</code></pre>

<p>Or install it yourself as:</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby">$ gem install repository-base
</code></pre>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<h3 id="important-legacy-notice">IMPORTANT LEGACY NOTICE</h3>

<p><strong><em>NOTICE!</em></strong> This Gem was created to support a solo, ad-hoc, early learning experience in what is now known as Clean Architecture. It was part of our first attempt to build an alternative to the ActiveRecord/ActiveModel scheme native to Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p>As such, it has been superseded and far outshone by other, team efforts, notably <a href="http://rom-rb.org/">ROM</a> as used with <a href="http://hanamirb.org/">Hanami</a> and <a href="http://trailblazer.to/">Trailblazer</a>. You are <em>strongly advised</em> to examine these and other tools rather than to use this for <em>any</em> new development. The Gem is being republished as an 0.4.0 release purely for internal archaeological purposes.</p>

<h3 id="concepts">Concepts</h3>

<p>As mentioned at the top of this file, <code>Repository::Base</code> is intended to serve as
the base class for your app’s Repositories. As with most Data Mapper
implementations, it makes use of a database access object, or DAO, which you
specify as one of the two parameters to <code>#initialize</code>. The other parameter is an
“entity factory”, whose <code>.create</code> class method hands back an “entity” reflecting
the content of an individual record in the underlying DAO.</p>

<h4 id="entities">Entities</h4>

<p>What is an “entity”? It’s a domain object in your application, with methods
expressing the business logic applicable to the object represented by the underlying
database record. This is distinct from an ActiveRecord-style <em>model</em>, in that
more than one variation of entity may exist in your application for a given DAO.
Most applications have Users, for example; some applications may have distinct
variation of User <em>entities</em> (ordinary punters, admins, a “guest user” entity
representing a user who has not authenticated as a more-privileged user, etc),
that all share a common persistence layer (the underlying DAO) and an entity
factory that <em>knows</em> how to create the correct type of entity for a given DAO
record.</p>

<p>An entity is uniquely identified by a <em>slug</em> rather than a numeric ID. Generally,
a slug encodes textual, relatively SEO-friendly information corresponding to an
individual record (the title of an article, the name of a user, etc) such that
the corresponding record may be uniquely identified by the DAO. This is in
preference to a “traditional” numeric record ID number; <code>Repository::Base</code> has
no knowledge of nor direct support for numeric record IDs.</p>

<h4 id="entity-factories">Entity Factories</h4>

<p>Again, the entity factory, one of the parameters to this class’ <code>#initialize</code>
method, is responsible for creating an entity from a DAO instance (record). The
<code>Repository::Base</code> class knows nothing of the details of how that is done; it
simply calls methods on the DAO and/or entity factory to accomplish the tasks
encapsulated by its own individual methods.</p>

<h4 id="storeresult">StoreResult</h4>

<p>What is a <code>StoreResult</code>? It is a simple value object which communicates the
result of a call to a method on the underlying DAO <em>as reported by the DAO</em>,
with the following properties:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>success?</code> (accessible as <code>result.success?</code> or as <code>result[:success?]</code>), has the value <code>true</code> after a successful operation or <code>false</code> after an unsuccessful one;</li>
  <li><code>entity</code> (<code>result.entity</code> or <code>result[:entity]</code>) is the instance or enumeration of instances of your domain entity resulting from a successful operation. After an unsuccessful operation, this property will be <code>nil</code>;</li>
  <li><code>errors</code> (<code>result.errors</code> or <code>result[:errors]</code>) is an Array-like object which is empty after a successful operation. After an unsuccessful operation, it will contain an Array of Hash instances, with each Hash having a key identifying the field or similar concept for which an individual error is being reported, and a value of the specific error message. For example, to report that a <code>:name</code> field was empty or blank, you might have a Hash of `{ name: ‘is empty or blank’ }. Your application domain logic should then understand how to deal with that convention.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="repositorybase-instance-methods"><code>Repository::Base</code> Instance Methods</h4>

<ul>
  <li><code>#add</code> adds a new record to the underlying <em>DAO</em> (data-access object; see above) using the field values specified by the <em>entity</em> passed as the only parameter. Returns a <code>StoreResult</code> (see above) which indicates the success or failure of the operation. On success, the <code>StoreResult</code> contains a <em>new</em> entity that represents the state of the record added to the underlying DAO;</li>
  <li><code>#all</code> returns a collection of entities matching all records as reported by the underlying DAO, with entities created by the appropriate entity factory;</li>
  <li><code>#delete</code> instructs the DAO to delete the record corresponding to the specified <code>slug</code>. Returns a <code>StoreResult</code> with an entity corresponding to the deleted record on success, or with appropriate error message(s) on failure;</li>
  <li><code>#find_by_slug</code> instructs the DAO to retrieve the record whose unique slug value matches the supplied parameter. On success, returns a <code>StoreResult</code> with an entity corresponding to the selected record; on failure, the <code>StoreResult</code> has an <code>entity</code> value of <code>nil</code> and appropriate error messages in <code>errors</code>;</li>
  <li><code>update</code> causes the DAO to attempt to update the record identified by the passed-in slug using the passed-in field values. On success, returns a <code>StoreResult</code> whose <code>entity</code> value mirrors the updated DAO record; on failure, has appropriate error indications in the <code>StoreResult</code>’s <code>errors</code> property.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="more-details">More Details</h3>

<p>This Gem now has <a href="./doc/index.html">full documentation available</a>. (No, this isn’t 1990s-era <code>rdoc</code>.)</p>

<p>This Gem was built with <strong>MRI Ruby 2.5.0</strong>. It <strong>is likely to</strong> work when rebuilt with any version after 2.0.0; however, as it makes use of <a href="http://ruby-doc.org//core-2.1.0/doc/syntax/methods_rdoc.html#label-Keyword+Arguments">keyword arguments</a> for various methods, it is <em>incompatible</em> with Ruby 1.9 or earlier.</p>

<h2 id="contributing">Contributing</h2>

  <li>Push to the branch (<code>git push origin my-new-feature</code>)</li>
  <li>Create a new Pull Request. Describe at some length the rationale for your new feature; your implementation strategy at a higher level than each individual commit message; anything future maintainers should be aware of; and so on. <em>If this is a modification to existing code, reference the open issue being addressed</em>.</li>
  <li>Don’t be discouraged if the PR generates a discussion that leads to further refinement of your PR through additional commits. These should <em>generally</em> be discussed in comments on the PR itself; discussion in the Gitter room (see below) may also be useful;</li>
  <li>If you’ve comments, questions, or just want to talk through your ideas, don’t hesitate to hang out in the project’s <a href="https://gitter.im/jdickey/repository-base">room on Gitter</a>. Ask away!</li>
